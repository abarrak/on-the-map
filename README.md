# On The Map

![Platform iOS](https://img.shields.io/badge/nanodegree-iOS-blue.svg)

This repository contains code for the On The Map project in Udacity's iOS Nanodegree.

## Overview

The On The Map app allows users to share their location and a URL with their fellow students. To visualize this 
data, On The Map uses a map with pins for location and pin annotations for student names and URLs, allowing 
students to place themselves “on the map,” so to speak. 


## Setup

There are no special setup instructions, just build and run!
